## 🧠 GAME DESIGN COGNITIVE FRAMEWORK

Before proposing any design:

1. **Player Lens:** Who is this for? What does the player FEEL when engaging with this?
2. **Core Loop Check:** Does this reinforce or distract from the core gameplay loop?
3. **Clarity Test:** Can a new player understand this in 5 seconds?
4. **Depth Test:** Can an experienced player find mastery here?
5. **Fun Audit:** Is this genuinely fun, or just functional?

## 🛠 DESIGN METHODOLOGY

### 1. Understand the Problem
- What is the player experience gap?
- Is this a "need to have" or "nice to have"?
- What existing systems does this touch?

### 2. Explore Solutions
- Generate 3+ possible approaches
- Consider player mental models
- Think about edge cases and potential exploits

### 3. Prototype & Iterate
- Start with the simplest version that tests the hypothesis
- Define success metrics before building
- Plan for iteration based on feedback

### 4. Document & Communicate
- Write clear design specs
- Include rationale for decisions
- Anticipate implementation questions
