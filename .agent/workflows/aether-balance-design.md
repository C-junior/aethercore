## 🎯 AETHERCORE BALANCE CONTEXT

**AetherCore: Spirit Tactics** requires careful balancing across:

### Spirit Balance Matrix

| Element | Strength | Weakness | Design Intent |
|---------|----------|----------|---------------|
| 🔥 Fire | High burst damage | Low survivability | Glass cannon |
| 💧 Water | Healing/sustain | Lower DPS | Support/tank hybrid |
| ⚡ Electric | Speed/chain effects | Fragile | Control/combo enabler |
| 🌿 Nature | Buffs/debuffs | Slow ramp | Late-game scaling |
| 🌑 Dark | Lifesteal/debuffs | Countered by burst | Risk/reward sustain |

### Key Balance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current Status |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **First Battle Win Rate** | 85-95% | Check T1 spirit stats |
| **Boss Clear Rate** | 40-60% | Tuned for challenge |
| **Average Run Length** | 15-25 min | Respects player time |
| **Spirit Pick Rate** | <30% variance | No "must-picks" |
| **Gold per Run** | 150-300 avg | Enables 2-3 purchases |

### Tier Power Scaling

```
T1 Base → T2 (1.5x power) → T3 (2.25x power)

Example: Embera (Fire Starter)
T1: HP 80, ATK 15, DEF 5
T2: HP 120, ATK 22, DEF 8
T3: HP 180, ATK 33, DEF 12
```

### Economy Flow

```
[Battle Win] → +20-40 Gold
[Elite Win]  → +50-80 Gold + Item
[Boss Win]   → +100 Gold + Rare Item
[Shop Costs] → Spirit: 30-60 | Item: 20-50 | Upgrade: 40-80
```

## 🧠 BALANCE COGNITIVE FRAMEWORK

Before adjusting any numbers:

1. **Identify the Problem:** What feels wrong? Win rate? Power spike? Economy?
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Is this a single value or systemic issue?
3. **Ripple Effects:** What else will this change affect?
4. **Player Perception:** Will players notice/appreciate this change?
5. **Reversion Plan:** How do we roll back if this makes things worse?

---

## 🛠 BALANCE METHODOLOGY

### 1. Data Collection
- Gather relevant metrics (win rates, pick rates, gold flow)
- Identify outliers and trends
- Compare against design targets

### 2. Analysis
- Is this a numbers problem or a design problem?
- Single variable or systemic issue?
- Player skill variance vs. balance issue?

### 3. Adjustment Strategy
- **Buff the Weak** preferred over **Nerf the Strong** (feels better)
- Small incremental changes (10-20%) vs. drastic shifts
- Consider soft counters before hard nerfs

### 4. Validation
- Define expected outcome before implementation
- Plan measurement approach
- Set timeline for evaluation

## 📊 BALANCE FORMULAS & GUIDELINES

### Damage Per Second (DPS)
```
DPS = (Base ATK × Attack Speed) × (1 - Enemy DEF / (Enemy DEF + 100))
```

### Effective HP (EHP)
```
EHP = HP × (1 + DEF / 100)
```

### Time To Kill (TTK)
```
TTK = Enemy EHP / Player DPS
Target: 3-8 seconds for normal enemies, 15-30 for elites, 45-90 for bosses
```

### Gold Economy Balance
```
Run Income (avg) = 200-250 gold over 8-10 battles
Run Expenses (target) = 3-4 meaningful purchases
→ Average purchase should cost 50-70 gold
```

### XP Curve
```
Level 2: 100 XP (1-2 battles)
Level 3: 250 XP (3-4 battles)
Level 4: 500 XP (5-7 battles)
Level 5 (Max): 1000 XP (full run)
```

## 📢 COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

When proposing balance changes:

1. **Issue Identified** — What's the balance problem?
2. **Current Values** — What are the existing numbers?
3. **Proposed Changes** — Specific new values with reasoning
4. **Expected Impact** — How will this change player experience?
5. **Measurement Plan** — How do we validate success?
6. **Risk Assessment** — What could go wrong?

---

## ⚖️ BALANCE PRINCIPLES

1. **"Buff, Don't Nerf"** — Making things fun is better than making things less fun
2. **"Feel Over Numbers"** — Sometimes 5% feels like 50%; perception matters
3. **"Counter-Play Exists"** — Every strategy should have a counter
4. **"No Trap Options"** — Every choice should be viable in some context
5. **"Respect Investment"** — Don't invalidate player progress with nerfs
6. **"Data + Intuition"** — Numbers inform, but don't dictate

## 🎯 BALANCE RED FLAGS

Watch for these warning signs:

| Red Flag | Indicates |
|----------|-----------|
| 100% pick rate for one spirit | Overpowered, needs tuning |
| 0% pick rate for any spirit | Underpowered or unclear value |
| First battle losses > 15% | Onboarding too harsh |
| Players stuck at same point | Difficulty spike |
| Gold hoarding (>200 unspent) | Nothing worth buying |
| Instant purchases (0 hesitation) | Prices too low |
